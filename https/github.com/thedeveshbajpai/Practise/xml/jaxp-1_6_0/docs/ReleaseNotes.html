      <br>March 3, 2014

    <p>
        The updates in JAXP 1.6 are primarily motivated by the JDK 8 effort 
        <a href="http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/162">Prepare for Modularization</a>.
        To allow for future modularization of the Java SE platform where service 
        providers may be deployed by means other than JAR files and perhaps without 
        the service configuration files, the <a href="https://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=206">
        JAXP 1.6 specification</a> requires the 
        use of the service provider loader facility defined by java.util.ServiceLoader 
        to load services from service configuration files. This change has been
        incorporated into JDK 8.
        Please read below for more details about this update. </p>

        <p><h3>
            Changes and bug fixes:
        </h3>
        </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Locating and loading Service Providers<br>
            <p>
            JAXP performs a 4 step procedure to locate and load service providers. In JAXP 1.6,
            the manual process of reading the service files in the 3rd step is replaced by 
            using the service provider loader facility defined by java.util.ServiceLoader.
            For compatibility, please see the compatibility section below.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>Security<br>
            <p>
            JAXP 1.6 RI includes the relevant security fixes that were included in JDK 7 update 51
            please refer to

        <p><h3>
            Compatibility
        </h3>
        </p>        
    <ol>
        <li>Custom ClassLoaders<br>
        <p>
            Service providers across JAXP will now be located consistently following 
            the process as defined in java.util.ServiceLoader. The changes may result 
            in some subtle differences from implementations of prior releases where 
            the provider-configuration file may have been located differently, for example, 
            by using a different getResourceXXX method of the ClassLoader than ServiceLoader.
            Applications that implement their own Classloaders shall therefore make sure 
            that the ClassLoaders' getResourceXXX methods are implemented consistently so as to 
            maintain compatibility.
        </p>
        </li>
        <li>StAX API<br>
        <p>
            The StAX API 1.2, JSR 173 MR3, defined newInstance/newFactory methods that take two 
            parameters: a factoryId and classLoader.
            The first parameter (factoryId) did not constrain what the value could be in 
            the StAX specification, it implied it could be any arbitrary string. With 
            <a href="https://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=206">JAXP 1.6 specification</a> 
            change, in the context of JAXP, the value of factoryId must be the 
            name of the base service class if it is intended to represent the name of the 
            service configuration file, that is, if it is not the name of a System Property.
        </p>
        <p>
            The second parameter (classLoader) was ignored by the factories when looking up 
            and instantiating the services. This is no longer the case in JAXP 1.6 and JDK 8. 
            JAXP 1.6 now loads implementations with the specified classLoader when it is not null.
            
        </p>
        </li>
        <li>JDK Source Level<br>
        <p>
            Previous versions of JAXP implementation supported JDK 5. Starting from JAXP 1.6,
            JDK 6 and later are required due to the use of java.util.ServiceLoader.
        </p>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        <p><h3>
            End of JAXP Standalone distribution
        </h3>
        </p>        
    <ol>
        JAXP 1.6  will be the final standalone release.  All future revisions to the JAXP API 
        will be part of the Java SE specification, starting with Java SE 9.
        Future JAXP development will be done solely within the <a href="http://openjdk.java.net/">
